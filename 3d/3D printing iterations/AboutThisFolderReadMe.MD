I uploaded all the iterations of all of the different designs to this folder.

To navigate:

1: Find which part you are looking for and navigate to that folder. (ex: Servo Mount)

2: In the folder, there will be all the dates of iterations, and in parentheses how many iterations are inside. (ex: 7-4-24 (1))

3: Each STL file has three parts. The first is a abbreviation of the part. The second is the date. The third is the iteration number for that day. (ex: SM 7-4-29 #1)

The newest iteration will be on the latest day, and have the highest iteration number on the day.
